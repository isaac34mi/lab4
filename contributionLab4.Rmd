##Checking Statements 


The following is a contribution for Lab 4.

Here we check veracity for the following statement:

"Of the nine Avengers we see on screen — Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and The Vision — every single one of them has died at least once in the course of their time Avenging in the comics. In fact, Hawkeye died twice"



```

{r echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

av <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/avengers/avengers.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

qq <- av %>% select(-c(URL,Notes,Return1, Return2, Return3, Return4, Return5))

q<- qq %>% gather(key=Time, value = Death, c(Death1, Death2, Death3, Death4, Death5)) %>%
                                            mutate(Time = parse_number(Time, na = c("", "NA")))

#check for "every single one of them has died at least once" and "Hawkeye died twice"
q[grep("Anthony Edward \"Tony\" Stark|Robert Bruce Banner|Steven Rogers|Thor|Clinton Francis|Natalia Alianovna Romanova|Scarlet Witch|Pietro Maximoff|Jonas", deaths$Name.Alias), "special_9"] <- "YES"

q %>% filter(special_9 == "YES") 
head(q)


```
From the obtained table we can conclude that
every single one of them has died at least  : TRUE
Hawkeye died twice							            : TRUE
